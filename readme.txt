# Employee ERP System

The **Employee ERP System** is a Python-based desktop application for managing employee records, equipment assignments, and payroll. The system uses **Tkinter** for the user interface and **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)** for database management. It incorporates **design patterns** for scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.

---

## Features

### 1. **Employee Management**
- Add, update, delete, and view employee details.
- Custom `EmployeeID` generation in the format `<Department>--<Number>` (e.g., `HR--001`).

### 2. **Equipment Management**
- Track and manage equipment like laptops, monitors, and keyboards.
- Assign equipment to employees.
- Generate unique serial numbers based on equipment type and brand using a configurable format.

### 3. **Payroll Management**
- Calculate employee payroll, including base salary, bonuses, and deductions.
- Automatically compute `NetPay`.
- Generate and view payroll records.

## Design Patterns Used

### **Creational Patterns**
1. **Abstract Factory:** For generating serial numbers based on equipment type and brand.
2. **Singleton:** Ensures a single instance of the database connection.
3. **Builder:** Constructs payroll objects with multiple attributes like bonuses and deductions.

### **Structural Patterns**
1. **Proxy:** Secures database access using an intermediary handler.
2. **Composite:** Manages equipment assignments as a part-whole structure.
3. **Adapter:** Adapts UI events to backend operations.

### **Behavioral Patterns**
1. **Observer:** Notifies employees about equipment assignments and payroll updates.
2. **Strategy:** Allows flexible payroll calculation methods.
3. **Command:** Encapsulates user actions like button clicks for modularity.

## Requirements

### **Software**
- Python 3.9+
- Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) with SSMS
- Tkinter (pre-installed with Python)

### **Python Libraries**
Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pyodbc
pip install pandas
```

## Database Schema

### Tables
1. **Employee**
   - `EmployeeID` (Primary Key): Custom ID in the format `<Department>--<Number>`.
   - `Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Department`, `Designation`, `DateOfJoining`.

2. **Equipment**
   - `EquipmentID` (Primary Key): Auto-incremented.
   - `Type`, `Brand`, `SerialNumber` (Unique), `Status`.

3. **EquipmentAssignment**
   - `AssignmentID` (Primary Key): Auto-incremented.
   - Foreign Keys: `EquipmentID`, `EmployeeID`.
   - `AssignedDate`, `ReturnedDate`.

4. **Payroll**
   - `PayrollID` (Primary Key): Auto-incremented.
   - Foreign Key: `EmployeeID`.
   - `BaseSalary`, `Bonus`, `Deductions`, `NetPay`.

## How to Run

### 1. **Set Up the Database**
- Use the SQL scripts provided in `database.sql` to create and initialize the database.
- Modify the database connection details in the Python code (`DatabaseHandler` class).

### 2. **Run the Application**
Run the main Python file:
```bash
python main.py
```
